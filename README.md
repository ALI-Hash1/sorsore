## What is Sorsore

Sorsore is the first CRX fork designed and built for the Persian language
Sorsore's main goal is to fix crx bugs, add new features, and most importantly,
add Farsi language to it so that a powerful yet simple cms can be built for Iranian users to easily produce and publish their web pages.
